| Symbol | Name           | Description                                         |
|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| $S$ | State Space | Possible values taken by the Markov chain |
| $P$ | Transition matrix  | A matrix containing the probabilities of going between state spaces, rows being "old" and columns being "new" spaces, all 1-step |
| $P_{ij}$ | Transition probability | A probability of Markov Chain going from state $i$ to state $j$ in 1-step|
| $P_{ij}^n$ | Transition probability | A probability of Markov Chain going from state $i$ to state $j$ in n-steps|
| $\lambda$ | Initial distribution | A vector containing distribution of the first state of the chain |
| $\lambda_i$ | Initial probability of state $i$ | A probability of state $i$ being the first state of the Markov's chain, $i$'th entry of $\lambda$ |
| $d_i$ | State Period | Greatest Common divisor of all loops leading from state $i$ to $i$ |
| $H_j$ | State first hitting time | Number of steps until state $j$ is hit. Is 0 if the start point is state $j$ |
| $H_A$ | Set first hitting time | Number of steps until set $A$ is hit. Is 0 if the start point is a state in set $A$ |
| $h_{ij}$ | State hitting probability | Probability of reaching state $j$ from state $i$. |
| $h_{iA}$ | Set hitting probability | Probability of entering a set $A$ from state $i$. |
| $\eta_{ij}$ | State expected hitting time | Expected number of steps until state $j$ is reached from state $i$ |
| $\eta_{iA}$ | Set expected hitting time | Expected number of steps until set $A$ is reached from state $i$ |
| $T_i$ | First Return time | Number of steps until state $i$ loops on itself |
| $f_i$ | Return probability | probability of chain returning back to state $i$ from $i$, basically $h_{ii}$ |
| $m_i$ | Expected return time | Expected number of steps until state $i$ loops on itself, basically $\eta_{ii}$ | 
| $V_j$ | Number of visits | Number of visits to state $j$ |
| $V_A$ | Number of visits | Number of visits to set of states $A$ |
| $\mathcal{T}$| Set of Transient States | Subset of $S$, containing all transient states |
| $\mu$ | Invariant Measure | A vector of positive entries, describing the measure, or "weight" of each state at every step of the chain. Has a property of $\mu=\mu P^n$ |
| $\pi$ | Invariant Distribution | A special case of invariant measure, distribution describing the distribution of the chain at every step of the chain, has a property of $\pi=\pi P^n$ and $\sum_{i\in S}\pi_i=1$. Not every chain has $\pi$. |
| $\gamma_i^k$ | Expected number of visits | Expected number of visits to state $i$ before chain returns to state $k$|
| $\Pi$ | Long Term Transition Matrix | $\Pi = \lim_{{n \to \infty}} P^n$, with all rows equal to $\pi$. Describes the behaviour of the chain after arbitrarily many steps. Not applicable to every Markov Chain |
| $G=(V, E)$ | Graph | Graph $G$, where $V$ is a set of vertices and $E\subset S \times S$, set of all edges. All graphs in this module are connected and weighted |
| $V$ | Set of all vertices | Set of all vertices in a graph. In this module, $V=S$ |
| $E$ | Set of all edges | Set containing all connections in a graph, is a subset of $S\times S$. As all the graphs are connected, for any 2 points $x,y \in V$ there exists a subset of $E$ connecting them |
| $w(x,y)$ | Weight between vertices $x$ and $y$ | A non-negative real number, describing the weight of an edge. $w(x,y)=0$ if $x,y\notin E$, and $w(x,y)>0$ otherwise. |
| $W(x)$ | Sum of weights of edges connected to vertex $x$ | Positive(due to connected graph assumption) number, describing the sum of all edges connecting $x$ with the rest of the graph: $W(x)=\sum_{y \in V}w(x,y)<\infty$ $\forall x \in V$|

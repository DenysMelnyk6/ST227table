| Symbol | Name           | Description                                         |
|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| $S$ | State Space | Possible values taken by the Markov chain |
| $P$ | Transition matrix  | A matrix containing the probabilities of going between state spaces, rows being "old" and columns being "new" spaces, all 1-step |
| $P_{ij}$ | Transition probability | A probability of Markov Chain going from state $i$ to state $j$ in 1-step|
| $P_{ij}^n$ | Transition probability | A probability of Markov Chain going from state $i$ to state $j$ in n-steps|
| $\lambda$ | Initial distribution | A vector containing distribution of the first state of the chain |
| $\lambda_i$ | Initial probability of state $i$ | A probability of state $i$ being the first state of the Markov's chain |
| $d_i$ | State Period | Greatest Common divisor of all loops leading from state $i$ to $i$ |
| $h_{ij}$ | Hitting time | Probability of reaching state $j$ from state $i$. |
| $h_{iA}$ | Hitting time | Probability of entering a set $A$ from state $i$. |
| $\eta_{ij}$ | Expected hitting time | Expected number of steps until state $j$ is reached from state $i$ |
| $\eta_{iA}$ | Expected hitting time | Expected number of steps until set $A$ is reached from state $i$ |
| $T_i$ | First Return time | Number of steps until state $i$ loops on itself |
| $f_i$ | Return probability | probability of chain returning back to state $i$ from $i$, basically $h_{ii}$ |
| $m_i$ | Expected return time | Expected number of steps until state $i$ loops on itself, basically $\eta_{ii}$ |
